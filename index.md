title: "Service Entrance Info"
---
## Built for movers

Service Entrance Info is inspired by the way you move. From
booking the job to making your customer happy, you can find and share all the
information about a service entrance necessary to do a better move.

### Where is it?

The most common question you will ask a coworker, a doorman or a superintendent
is, "Where is the service entrance?" If you know the answer, it can
save you a trip around the block in NYC traffic.

### COI?

You should know if you need COI, even before you book the job. If
possible, it would be nice to know if your insurance policy is good enough.

### Time restriction?

Some buildings are very flexible, some are very strict. To avoid any headaches,
find out when you are allowed to do the move.

### And more...

Is there an elevator? Is it big enough to fit a dolly (yes, we've seen smaller
than that)? Will it be reserved for the move? Am I gonna break my back on the
stairs? Am I gonna roll the dollies around the block? Am I gonna get a
parking ticket?

Keep asking, and we'll try to provide all the answers!
