title: "Service Entrance Info"
---
## Built for movers

Service Entrance Info is a platform inspired by the way you move. From
booking the job to making your customer happy, you can find and share all the
information about service entrance necessary to do a better move.

### COI?

You should know, at least, if you need it, even before you book the job. If
possible, it would be nice to know if your insurance policy is enough.

### Time restriction?

Some buildings are very flexible, some are very strict. To avoid any headaches,
find out when you are allowed to do the move.

### Where is it?

The most common question you will ask a coworker, a doorman or a superintendent.
Where is the service entrance? If you know the right answer, sometimes it can
save you up to 45 minutes driving around the block in NYC traffic.

### And more...

Is there an elevator? Is it big enough to fit a dolly (yes, we've seen smaller
than that)? Will it be reserved for the move? Am I gonna break my back on the
stairs? Am I gonna roll the dollies around the block? Am I gonna get the
parking ticket?

Keep asking your self, and we'll try to provide all the answers!
